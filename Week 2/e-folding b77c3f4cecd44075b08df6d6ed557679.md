# e-folding

# Definition

> In physics and other sciences, the `e-folding` time is the time it takes for an exponentially  growing quantity to increase by a factor of e, which is approximately 2.71828. It is the base-e analog doubling time.
> 

For example, if a population of bacteria is growing exponentially, the e-folding time would be the time it taks for the population to double. E-folding is also used to describe the time it takes for a radioactive substance to decay by half.

# Formula

The formua for the e-folding time is:

$\textcolor{red}{\tau} = 1/k$

where:

- $\textcolor{red}{\tau}$ is the `e-folding` time
- k is the `rate constant`

The `rate constant` is a measure of how quickly a quantity changes over time. 

For example, the `rate constant` for radioactive decay is the probability that a radioactive atom will decay in a given time interval.

The `e-folding time` is a useful concept for understanding exponential growth and decay. For example, if a population of bacteria is growing exponentially, the `e-folding time` would be the time it takes for the population to double. `E-folding time` is also used to describe the time it takes for a radioactive substance to decay by half.

Here are some examples of how the `e-folding time` can be used:

- **********************************Radioactive decay**********************************: The `e-folding time` for radioactive decay is the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay. 
For example, the `e-folding time` for carbon-14 is 5,730 years. This means that half of the carbon-14 atoms in a sample will decay in 5,730 years, and half of the remaining atoms will decay in the next 5,730 years, and so on.
- **********************************Population growth**********************************: The `e-folding time` for population growth is the time it takes for a population to double. 
For example, the `e-folding time` for the human population is about 35 years. This means that the human population doubles every 35 years.
- ************************************Chemical reactions************************************: The `e-folding time` for a chemical reaction is the time it takes for the concentration of reactants to decrease by a factor of e.
For example, the `e-folding time` for the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water is about 10 seconds. This means that the concentration of hydrogen and oxygen in a mixture will decrease by a factor of e every 10 seconds.
